If the user clicks "OK", the password generator will print "Password Generator commenced!" to the console, and the second prompt will open.

An alert window will appear verifying the length of the password chosen by the user. This number will also print to the console.

The user will be presented with a series of prompts to include numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. In each prompt if the user selects "OK", that character set will be included, if the user selects "cancel", that character set will not be included. 

Once the user has responded to all the character set prompts, and chosen at least one character set, an alert will appear verifying the character set/s chosen.

Once the user clicks "OK" on the character type alert, a randomised password will be generated according to the user-selected criteria, and that password will be printed to the text window, and also printed to the console.
